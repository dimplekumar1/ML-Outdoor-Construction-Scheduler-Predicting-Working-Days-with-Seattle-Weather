## Overview

The ML Outdoor Construction Scheduler project integrates machine learning techniques to optimize scheduling decisions for outdoor construction. By analyzing past weather patterns, the system predicts favorable conditions for construction activities, enhancing operational efficiency and minimizing weather-related delays.

## Features

- **Weather Prediction**: Forecasting temperature and weather conditions (rain, snow, sun) using Random Forest regression and classification models.
  
- **Day Classification**: Classifying days into working and non-working categories based on predicted weather attributes and historical data.

- **Visual Analysis**: Visualization of monthly average temperatures and weather distribution to provide insights into seasonal trends and patterns.

## Demo

- Enter a start date and end date to predict working days for construction based on weather forecasts.

### Evaluation:

The project evaluates model performance using the following metrics:
- **Accuracy**: Measures the percentage of correct predictions for weather conditions and day types.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Calculates the average difference between predicted and actual temperatures.
- **Classification Reports**: Provides precision, recall, and F1-score for weather and day type classifications.
